## Short Term Roadmap
- deep xstate integration
  - navigation 
  - "ambient" state machines
  - "pluggable actions"
    - send text / email / notification 
- constraints
  - specify expressions that must be met against various scopes
- optimisations
  - ability to index the results of expressions (e.g. "models") and refer to those in other expressions
  - full text indexing
- miscellaneous
  - core language updates
    - more syntax sugar
    - refactor common patterns into operators as they emerge
  - devtools integration
  - optimizations
    - static analysis of expressions
      - determine simple filters for underlying data stores (`where`, `topic`, etc.)
    - "fragment" optimization
    - optimise observable pulse / component rerender
  - infrastructure updates
    - no importing vocabulary on consumer - automatically fed from host
    - improved serialization
    - improved bootstrap / bundling
      - automatic hosting of build directory
    - improved documentation
    - "one click" container deployment
    - blog storage API
  
## The Horizon
- typescript integration (interfaces ONLY, no classes, EVER)
  - message types
    - eliminates need for topic
  - vocabulary
    - currently `stream` (default) and `aggregate` operator types
      - e.g. `groupBy` applies to stream type but returns an aggregate
    - add ability for custom operator types
  - decorators
    - populate message properties with 
      - auth info, e.g. user ID
      - timestamps
      - etc.
    - security information
      - vocabulary requires certain scope to be set
    - UI hints
- visual process designers
  - drag and drop process design
  - xstate visualizer is a starter
  - real time representation of current state
- scale out
  - BIG (read: FUN) challenge. I know the vague path to glory.
- security modelling
  - rich modelling using core language
  - restrictions over state machines
- peer to peer with WebRTC
- IoT

## The Grand Vision
- language designer, fed by AI processing of plain language specifications
- WYSIWYG designer, fed by metadata from language designer
  - a la Sketch, UX that encourages reusable, responsive components
  - automatic form generation from message metadata
  - automatic "best practice" theming (e.g. material design)
  - curated components
- visual process designer
- story boards / issue management integrated into every aspect
- integrated PaaS

- peer to peer social network
